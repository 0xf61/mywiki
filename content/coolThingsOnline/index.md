title: Cool Things Online

I use [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) and simple AI tools to build my own online pocket alternative.
I save webpages that I really enjoy reading or want to mention in my posts. I keep them here for easy access.
I do not copy the content from these webpages directly.
Instead, I try to rewrite and summarize what I understood from each referenced webpage in my own words.
My goal is to present the main ideas as I interpreted them, not to reproduce the original content.

If you are the owner of any content listed here and would like it removed, please contact me and I will take it down.
