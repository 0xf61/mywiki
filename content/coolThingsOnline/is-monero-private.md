Monero (XMR) is a digital money that tries to keep your transactions secret. Many people and companies have tried to track Monero, but it is much harder than with Bitcoin. This guide explains, in simple words, how Monero protects your privacy and what others have tried to break it.

## How Monero Hides Transactions

- **Ring Signatures:** Your transaction is mixed with others, so it is hard to know who sent it.
