SQL Injection is a serious problem for websites. It's like a sneaky way for bad people to trick the website's database by changing what you type into special commands. If they do this, they can see things they shouldn't, change important information, or even break the whole website.

This happens when the website just takes what you type and puts it directly into a question it asks the database, without checking if it's safe.

Imagine a simple question the website asks to check your login:

```

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'USER_INPUT' AND password = 'USER_INPUT';

```

If the website isn't careful, a bad person can type special things:

- **Username:** `admin'--`
- **Password:** `anything`

This makes the question look like this:

```

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin'--' AND password = 'anything';

```

The `--` part is like telling the database to ignore the password part, so they might get in without the right password if there is a user named "admin".

Bad people can also use the `UNION` word to ask for information from other places in the database. If the website asks:

```

SELECT name, email FROM users WHERE id = '$ID';

```

Someone might type something like:

```

1 UNION SELECT credit_card_number, security_code FROM creditcards

```

Then the question becomes:

```

SELECT name, email
FROM users
WHERE id = '1 UNION SELECT credit_card_number, security_code FROM creditcards';

```

Now, they might see secret information like credit card numbers, if the website isn't careful about how it shows the information.

Sometimes, the website makes mistakes and shows messages that tell bad people how the database is set up. This helps them figure out how to trick it even more.

```

?id=1'

```

If the website says something about table or column names, the bad person can learn about the database and plan more tricks.

Here's how to stay safe:

1. **Use Safe Questions**
- Use special ways to ask questions to the database where what you type is always just seen as regular words, not commands.
- Most computer programs have ways to do this safely.
1. **Check and Clean What You Type**
- Make sure what people type is what you expect (like numbers or letters) before asking the database.
- Clean what people type to remove any special characters that could trick the database.
1. **Give Only Enough Power**
- Make sure the website only has permission to see and change what it needs to, and nothing more.
- Don't let the website have full control over the database.
1. **Hide Mistakes**
- Don't show everyone the detailed error messages from the database.
- Keep those messages hidden, but write them down in a secret place so you can fix problems.
