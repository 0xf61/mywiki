- Click the Apple icon at the top-left of your screen.
- Click "System Preferences" in the menu.
- Click "Security & Privacy."
- Click the "Privacy" tab.
- In the left sidebar, click "Location Services."
- Find "OpenVPN Connect" in the list of apps.
- Check the box next to "OpenVPN Connect" to allow location access.
- Close the "Security & Privacy" window.
- Open OpenVPN Connect and try connecting again.

Also, make sure the application can run in the background.

If the problem isn't location permissions, try this in your terminal:

1.  `sudo launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.openvpn.client.plist`

2.  `ps auxww | grep ovpnagent`

You should not see: `/Library/Frameworks/OpenVPNConnect.framework/Versions/Current/usr/sbin/ovpnagent`

3.  `sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.openvpn.client.plist`

4.  `ps auxww | grep ovpnagent`

You should see: `/Library/Frameworks/OpenVPNConnect.framework/Versions/Current/usr/sbin/ovpnagent` (owned by root)

5. Restart your Mac.

6. Connect to the VPN.

7. All done!
