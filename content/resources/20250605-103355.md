Data tampering happens when someone changes data in a system without permission. This can happen while the data is moving or when it's stored. This can mess up important information and cause problems like changing user access, prices, or how the system works.

Tampering attacks often target weak spots in systems, like insecure APIs or parts of the system that aren't checked properly. If the system doesn't have strong checks, attackers can change data to gain an advantage or cause trouble.

Common ways to do this include changing information in website requests, cookies, or even the code that the website uses.

```

<input type="hidden" name="price" value="9.99">

```

An attacker can use tools to change the price to 0.01 before sending the request:

```

POST /checkout
price=0.01&product_id=123

```

If the system doesn't double-check the price, the attacker can buy the item for much less.

If important information like login details is stored in cookies without protection, an attacker can change it:

```

Cookie: role=user

```

Changing it to:

```

Cookie: role=admin

```

can give them access to administrator features if the system trusts the cookie without checking.

APIs that use JSON data can be attacked if they don't check important information on the server:

```

{
  "user_id": 1001,
  "amount": 100.00
}

```

An attacker can change the user\_id to transfer money from another account:

```

{
  "user_id": 1002,
  "amount": 0.01
}

```

If important data is only checked on the website itself, attackers can bypass these checks by changing the website's code or using tools to send altered values directly.

Here's how to prevent data tampering:

1. **Always Check Data on the Server**

   - Never trust data from the user's computer. Always check and clean user input on the server.
   - Use strict rules for API requests to make sure the data is in the correct format.
2. **Use Integrity Checks**

   - Protect important data in cookies or website storage using methods like digital signatures or encryption.
   - Make sure values like prices or user roles can't be changed without the server knowing.
3. **Don't Rely on Hidden Information or Website Logic**

   - Don't put important variables (like prices or roles) on the website itself.
   - Always recalculate and double-check values like discounts on the server.
4. **Secure Communications**

   - Use HTTPS to protect data while it's being sent, preventing attackers from intercepting and changing it.
5. **Monitor and Log Everything**

   - Keep a record of all important transactions and changes to catch tampering attempts.
   - Use tools to detect unusual activity, like frequent role changes or unauthorized transfers.
6. **Use Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC)**

   - Make sure users can only do what they're allowed to do based on their role.
   - Always check user permissions for every request, not just when they log in.
7. **Use Hashing or Checksums for Important Data**

   - Use cryptographic hashing to make sure data (like files) hasn't been changed.
   - Always check these hashes before using sensitive data.
