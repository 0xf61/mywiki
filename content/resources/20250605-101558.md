The problem of using vulnerable parts happens when an app uses outside libraries, frameworks, plugins, or system parts that have known security problems. These parts, whether open-source or owned by a company, may have listed weaknesses (CVEs) that attackers can use to harm apps, steal data, or run bad code.

Many groups use outside parts to make development faster, but not watching and updating them can cause big security risks. Attackers often check apps for old versions of popular libraries or parts, using public lists of exploits to find known weaknesses. If these weak parts are not fixed or replaced, an attacker may get into the system without permission, run any code they want, or change how the system works.

Using an old version of a web framework can cause serious weaknesses:

- **Spring Framework (Java) – Remote Code Execution (CVE-2022-22965)**
- An app using Spring 5.3.0 may be weak to the Spring4Shell RCE exploit, letting attackers run any code on the server.
- **Django – SQL Injection (CVE-2019-19844)**
- Older versions of Django before 3.0.10 were weak to SQL injection because the system didn't clean queries well enough.

Front-end apps using old JavaScript libraries may be weak to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Prototype Pollution:

- **jQuery versions < 3.5.0**
- Weak to XSS injection if unsafe user input is given to `html()`.
- **Lodash versions < 4.17.21**
- Can be affected by Prototype Pollution, letting attackers change object properties and possibly run bad scripts.

Server-side parts like database systems, middleware, or web servers can also cause weaknesses:

- **Apache Log4j (CVE-2021-44228 – Log4Shell)**
- A very bad Remote Code Execution (RCE) weakness in Log4j versions < 2.15.0 let attackers control servers by putting bad code in logs.
- **OpenSSL (CVE-2014-0160 – Heartbleed)**
- The Heartbleed weakness let attackers read sensitive memory, including encryption keys, from OpenSSL 1.0.1.

1. **Watch and Update Dependencies Regularly**
- Use tools to track and update weak parts:
    - `npm audit fix` (Node.js)
    - `pip list --outdated` (Python)
    - `mvn versions:display-dependency-updates` (Java Maven)
- Make sure libraries and frameworks are updated to the newest stable versions.
1. **Do Regular Vulnerability Scans**
- Use Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to find and manage weak parts:
    - OWASP Dependency-Check (Java, .NET, Python)
    - Snyk (Multiple languages)
    - GitHub Dependabot (Automated alerts for outdated dependencies)
1. **Replace Old or Unmaintained Components**
- Don't use libraries or frameworks that are no longer being updated.
- If a part is not supported, move to a safer option.
1. **Use Strict Version Control**
- Use dependency pinning ( `package-lock.json`, `requirements.txt`) to stop accidental updates to weak versions.
- Don't use wildcard versions (\*, latest) in package management files.
1. **Apply Security Patches Immediately**
- Watch security alerts and CVE reports for important updates for your software.
- Automate patch management to lower the risk of zero-day exploits.
1. **Do Secure Code Review and Testing**
- Add vulnerability detection to CI/CD pipelines to stop deploying apps with known weaknesses.
- Do manual security reviews of outside parts before using them in production.
