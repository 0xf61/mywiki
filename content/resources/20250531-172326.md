S3-compatible Object Storage provides you with storage space to save data in "Buckets." In Hetzner, all the data you save is stored in a Ceph cluster. If you use it publicly, everyone can access it as follows:

```
https://<bucket-name>.<location>.your-objectstorage.com/<file-name>
```

ShellScript

Uploaded files cannot be changed, so the main purpose is to use it as WORM (Write once, read many \[times\]).

- Hosting a static website
- Keeping backups
- Sharing data publicly or privately

It can be used with other cloud-based applications without any restrictions. Hetzner’s Object Storage product is S3 compatible, so it works seamlessly with all applications that are S3-compatible. You can use all the software officially developed by Amazon.

| Source | Feature | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Buckets | Create | **Header:** x-amz-bucket-object-lock-enabledx-amz-acl (allowed value: `private`) |
| **CreateBucketConfiguration XML Body:** LocationConstraint |
| List |  |
| Delete |  |
| Location |  |
| HeadBucket |  |
| ACL |  |
| Policy |  |
| Encryption (SSE only) |  |
| Lifecycle |  |
| Objects | PutObject |  |

| DeleteObject |  |
| HeadObject |  |
| ACL |  |
| ObjectLock<br>(must be selected during bucket creation) | Retention<br>Legal Hold |
| Tagging |  |
| Versions |  |

You can also use the mc application developed by minio, as well as tools such as boto3 and s3cmd.

If you want to use it in Python, you can use the following example:

```
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError

s3 = boto3.resource('s3',
  endpoint_url='https://XYZ.fsn1.your-objectstorage.com',
  aws_access_key_id='<ACCESS KEY>',
  aws_secret_access_key='<SECRET KEY>',
  aws_session_token=None,
  config=boto3.session.Config(signature_version='s3v4'),
  verify=True,
)

bucket_name = 'your-unique-bucket-name'

try:
  response = s3.create_bucket(Bucket=bucket_name)
  print(f"Bucket {bucket_name} created successfully.")
except ClientError as e:
  print(f"Error creating bucket: {e}")
```

Python

I would like to remind you that we made this configuration according to the feature set supported by Hetzner.

| Feature | Supported Standard |
| --- | --- |
| AWS Signature version | Version 4 algorithm |
| Storage classes | Standard |
| Server-Side Encryption (SSE) | SSE-C |

## How to Create an S3 Bucket in Hetzner?

To create an S3 bucket directly via the interface, select "Object Storage" from the left menu within the Project. Click the "Create Bucket" button and fill it in appropriately.

![Object storage budget control screen](https://cdn.mertcangokgoz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hetzner-s3-bucket-nasil-olusturulur-gorsel1.png)

The moment you say "Create & But Now", your bucket starts to be prepared and becomes active in a very short time. It starts to appear on your panel as follows.

![Hetzner object storage panel, Germany location.](https://cdn.mertcangokgoz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hetzner-s3-bucket-nasil-gozukur-gorsel2.png)

You can upload your files either via the **"Files"** tab with the **"Upload Files"** instructions, or via S3 API-supported applications.

## How to Get Hetzner S3 Credentials?

Switch to **"Security"** on the left menu, then click on the **"S3 Credentials"** tab. Click **"Generate credentials"** from the area that appears and enter a description.

![S3 credentials creation screen, description box.](https://cdn.mertcangokgoz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hetzner-s3-bucket-credential-nasil-alinir-gorsel3.png)

It will give you 2 keys like the following, with which you can access your bucket and do whatever you want.

```
Access Key: 2T3BUTKTB6G580HKFKTK
Secret Key: EVjEioyd7WCQhYRUi3ScFJ8r0NoKqQRM6WIOSbbI
```

Python

Unlike other providers, you can enter an access rule for this key you created. You can restrict it to the bucket it needs to access.

- `project_id`: The ID of the project you created is written on the top of the browser (**https://console.hetzner.cloud/projects/<project-ID>/servers**)
- `access_key`: The access key information you received from the system
- `your-bucket-name`: Your bucket name.

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [\
    {\
      "Effect": "Allow",\
      "Principal": {\
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam:::user/p<project_id>:<access_key>"\
      },\
      "Action": "s3:*",\
      "Resource": [\
          "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",\
          "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"\
          ]\
    }\
  ]
}
```

Python

You can save this bucket policy you entered into the system with any S3-compatible API. If you want to use Minio's own client.

First, introduce the bucket you will use to mc

```
mc alias set hetzner-bucket \
  https://xyz.fsn1.your-objectstorage.com \
  <your_access_key> <your_secret_key> \
  --api "s3v4" \
  --path "off"
```

Python

Then, you can implement the following rule with the alias you created.

```
mc anonymous set-json my-policy.json hetzner-bucket/mertcangokgoz
```

Python

Some S3-compatible tools you can use

- [https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd](https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd)

## How to Enable S3 Bucket Versioning?

You can use the Versioning feature to prevent your objects from being accidentally deleted. Each object is automatically assigned a version ID, which allows you to keep multiple versions of the same object within a single bucket. If you upload an object with a name that already exists in the bucket (e.g., cemil.txt), the existing object will not be deleted; instead, the objects will be distinguished by version IDs. Manual deletion of objects is still possible. However, different versions continue to exist within the bucket.

Enabling it using Minio

```
mc version enable hetzner-bucket/mertcangokgoz
```

ShellScript

Enabling it using AWS Cli

```
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled --bucket mertcangokgoz
```

ShellScript

## How to Enable S3 Bucket Legal Hold?

Object Locking allows you to disable manual deletion of selected objects. With object locking, you can choose between "legal hold" and "retention" options. **Legal hold** prevents an object from being deleted until it is manually removed again. **Retention** prevents an object from being deleted until a certain period has passed.

There are two different modes of Retention: "Governance" and "Compliance".

|  | Automatic deletion | Manual deletion | `Objects with the same name` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Versioning** | disabled | active | To delete an object, you must first remove the legal hold. This does not require any special permission but adds an extra step that can help prevent accidental deletion. |
| **Legal Hold** | Versioning is automatically enabled and you cannot disable it. | To delete an object, you must first remove the **“legal hold”**. This does not require any special permission but adds an extra step that can help prevent accidental deletion. | Since versioning is automatically enabled, a new object with a different version ID is added. You will need to re-enable **“legal hold”** for the new object. |
| **Retention**<br>(Governance Mode) | Versioning is automatically enabled and you cannot disable it. | Only users with special permissions can terminate the retention period earlier and delete the object before the original retention period expires. | Since versioning is automatically enabled, a new object with a different version ID is added. You will need to reset the retention period for the new object. |
| **Retention**<br>(Compliance Mode) | Versioning is automatically enabled and you cannot disable it. | No one can terminate the retention period earlier, and it is not possible to delete the object before the retention period expires. | Since versioning is automatically enabled, a new object with a different version ID is added. You will need to reset the retention period for the new object. |

  --region fsn1 \
  --object-lock-enabled-for-bucket
```

ShellScript
