Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) happens when a bad person puts bad code into a place where you type things on a website. This code runs right away when the website shows you the page, but it doesn't stay on the website like a saved file. It's like if you wrote something on a whiteboard, and when someone else looked at it, your writing did something bad on their computer.

This bad code can do things like steal your login information or pretend to be you on the website. To do this, the bad person needs to trick you into clicking a special link or filling out a form with the bad code in it.

If a website takes what you type and shows it back to you, like in a search bar:

`https://example.com/search?q=something`

And the website doesn't check if what you typed is safe, a bad person could make a link like this:

`https://example.com/search?q=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`

If you click that link, your computer will run the bad code, and a box will pop up saying "XSS".

If you fill out a form on a website and it shows you what you typed (like if there's an error), a bad person could put bad code in the form:

```

<script>alert('Reflected XSS');</script>

```

Then, when the website shows you the page with your message, your computer will run the bad code.

Here's how to stay safe:

1. **Check What People Type**
- Don't let people type in bad words or computer code.
- Use special tools that clean up what people type.
2. **Be Careful What You Show**
- When the website shows you something, make sure it's safe.
- Use special codes to make sure the words don't run as computer code.
3. **Use a Security Guard**
- Tell your website to only run code from certain places.
- This is like having a security guard that stops bad code from running.
4. **Use Safe Tools**
- Use tools that automatically make things safe.
- Don't build websites by putting together pieces of code by hand. Use special tools that know how to keep things safe.
