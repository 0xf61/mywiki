Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) happens when someone puts bad computer code into a place where you can type things, and that code runs right away without being saved. This is different from stored XSS, where the bad code is saved. Reflected XSS only works for a short time. The bad code is usually in a link or form that someone needs to click or fill out.

When the bad code runs in your computer's web browser, it can steal your login information, take over your account, or do things as if it were you. To make this work, the attacker needs to trick you into clicking a special link or filling out a form with bad information.

If a website puts what you type directly onto the page, it can be used for reflected XSS. For example, a search bar:

`https://example.com/search?q=someinput`

If the website puts `someinput` onto the page without checking it, someone can make a link with bad code:

`https://example.com/search?q=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`

If you click this link, the bad code will run in your web browser.

If a form on a website takes what you type and shows it on the page (like an error message) without checking it, someone can send bad code:

```HTML hljs

<script>alert('Reflected XSS');</script>

```

Then, the website will show this code, and your browser will run it when you see the page.

Here are some ways to stop reflected XSS:

1. **Check What People Type**
   - Remove or change any bad letters or computer code.
   - Use good programs that can help check what people type.
2. **Make Sure Things Are Shown Correctly**
   - Change the way things look when they are shown on the page so that bad code can't run.
   - For example, change letters so they look like the right symbols in the right places.
3. **Use a Content Security Policy (CSP)**
   - Tell the browser where it is allowed to run computer code from.
   - This helps protect you if someone finds a way to put bad code on the page.
4. **Use Good Security Programs**
   - If the program you are using can automatically check and change things to be safe, turn that on.
   - Don't just put what people type directly onto the page. Use special tools that know how to show things safely.
