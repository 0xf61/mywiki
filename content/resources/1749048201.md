# Migrate from Docker Desktop to Podman on Darwin

2025-03-02

[#darwin](https://karnwong.me/tags/darwin) [#docker](https://karnwong.me/tags/docker)

Lately, Docker Desktop on Mac has been behaving strangely, especially with its inconsistent memory use. Because I don't want to constantly monitor the memory usage, I looked for other options and found a few: Colima, Podman, and Orbstack.

Since I like open-source software, I naturally preferred Colima and Podman. I felt that Podman was more refined. I tried it, and it worked well. Here's how I set it up to be compatible with tools that use the docker command and socket.

## Installing Podman [Anchor link for: installing-podman](https://karnwong.me/posts/2025/03/migrate-from-docker-desktop-to-podman-on-darwin/\#installing-podman)

```bash
brew install --cask podman-desktop
brew install podman
brew install podman-compose

```

## Shell Config [Anchor link for: shell-config](https://karnwong.me/posts/2025/03/migrate-from-docker-desktop-to-podman-on-darwin/\#shell-config)

I use Fish, but this can be used with other shells.

```bash
switch (uname)
case Darwin
# backward compatibility with docker command
function docker
podman $argv
end

# make it work with tools relying on docker socket
function lazydocker
DOCKER_HOST="unix://$(podman machine inspect --format '{{.ConnectionInfo.PodmanSocket.Path}}')" "$HOME/.nix-profile/bin/lazydocker"
end
end

```

# Migrate from Docker Desktop to Podman on Darwin

2025-03-02

[#darwin](https://karnwong.me/tags/darwin) [#docker](https://karnwong.me/tags/docker)

Lately Docker Desktop on Mac behaves weirdly, namely its erratic memory consumption. Not willing to babysit the memory usage, I looked into alternatives, and found a few contenders: Colima, Podman and Orbstack.

Being an open-source aficionado, naturally I gravitate to Colima and Podman. Although my spidey sense tells me Podman is more polished. Gave it a go and it works beautifully, so here's my setup to make it backward compatible with tools utilizing docker command and socket.

## Installing Podman [Anchor link for: installing-podman](https://karnwong.me/posts/2025/03/migrate-from-docker-desktop-to-podman-on-darwin/\#installing-podman)

```bash
brew install --cask podman-desktop
brew install podman
brew install podman-compose

```

## Shell Config [Anchor link for: shell-config](https://karnwong.me/posts/2025/03/migrate-from-docker-desktop-to-podman-on-darwin/\#shell-config)

I use Fish, but it can be applied to other shells.

```bash
switch (uname)
case Darwin
# backward compatibility with docker command
function docker
podman $argv
end

# make it work with tools relying on docker socket
function lazydocker
DOCKER_HOST="unix://$(podman machine inspect --format '{{.ConnectionInfo.PodmanSocket.Path}}')" "$HOME/.nix-profile/bin/lazydocker"
end
end

```
