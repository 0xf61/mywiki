Google has added a new option on Android phones. Now, users can turn off 2G connections. This is important because 2G connections have privacy and security problems that can be used by fake cell towers.

The EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) noticed this new option. They say it's a win for privacy.

## What are "stingrays"?

A "stingray" is a fake cell tower. It tricks phones into connecting to it.

When a phone connects to a stingray, the people controlling the stingray can see personal information, like:

- The phone's IMSI (a special ID number)
- Phone call details (who you called, how long you talked)
- Text messages and call content
- What websites you visit

Sometimes, the police use stingrays to find people. But, stingrays have also been used to spy on people at protests.

Regular people have also used stingrays to spy on others. This is because 2G connections have security problems. Stingrays can force phones to use 2G, even if the phone can use 4G. This lets them use the old security problems to spy on people.

Being able to turn off 2G is a good thing. It doesn't solve every security problem, but it's a good start.

## How to turn off 2G on Android

Google now lets you turn off 2G on your Android phone. But, it's turned on by default.

To turn it off, go to ' **Settings → Network & Internet → SIMs → Allow 2G**'. The exact steps might be different depending on your phone.

This option is only available on Android 12 for now. It's not available on Android 11 or 10.

Google says that your phone needs to have special hardware to use this option.

Also, 2G will still be used for emergency calls, even if you turn it off.

Apple doesn't let iPhone users turn off 2G. But now that Google is doing it, Apple might do it too.

It's not a big deal, but you can also do this on Android 10 and 11, at least on my OnePlus Nord. It doesn't say "disable 2g," but you can pick "automatic"(NR,LTE,3g2g) or NR,LTE,etc. I just pick NR,LTE so my phone will only use 5g4g.

I'm not sure what phones you're using, but on the S21+ with Android 12, I can't find this option. I looked everywhere. There's no way to only turn off 2g. I asked Samsung, and they said they don't think there's a way to do that on any Samsung phones. It might depend on your phone company. Some phone companies might let you do it, but others might not.

On almost all Android phones, even old ones, you can change the network mode in a hidden menu. You can set it to 4G/3G, 4G only, or whatever options aren't in the regular settings.

To find this menu, dial \*#\*#INFO#\*#\* or \*#\*#4636#\*#\*. Then pick Device Information and scroll down to Preferred Network Type. See what options you have. Some options might not work.

On most Samsung phones, you can dial \*#BANDS# or \*#2263# to get to the Bands menu. There, you can turn off 2G by finding the GSM options and picking BLOCK SET BY AP.
