# Is Monero Totally Private? A Comprehensive Analysis of De-Anonymization Attacks Against The Privacy Coin

### Analyzing Attempts to Deanonymize and Track Monero Transactions: A Technical and Strategic Overview.

**December 23, 2024**

**By: Trevor Baaddi**

Monero (XMR) is a type of digital money known for keeping your information safe. Some people, like governments and computer experts, have tried to find ways to track Monero transactions. Unlike Bitcoin, where everyone can see the transactions, Monero uses special features to keep things private, like hiding where the money came from, using secret addresses, and keeping the amount of money secret. This article looks at some of the ways people have tried to break Monero's privacy, how they did it, and how well it worked.

#### Monero’s Privacy Features: A Brief Overview

To understand why it's hard to track Monero, you need to know how it keeps your information safe:

- **Ring Signatures**: These mix the sender's information with fake information to hide where the money really came from.
- **Stealth Addresses**: These create a new, secret address for each transaction, so no one can connect the transactions to a real address.
- **Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT)**: These hide how much money is being sent.
- **Dandelion++ Protocol**: This makes it harder to find where a transaction started on the network.

Together, these features make it very difficult to see what's happening on the Monero blockchain.

#### 1\. Chainalysis and Monero Tracking Services

**Attempt**: Chainalysis is a company that looks at blockchain data. They have reportedly created tools to try to understand Monero transactions. They haven't shared many details about how they do it, but they have said they've had some success.

**Methodology**: They probably try to find weak spots in Monero's privacy, like looking at the timing of transactions or connecting information from outside the Monero network (like when people deposit or withdraw Monero from exchanges).

**Efficacy**: It's not very effective. Chainalysis's methods reportedly give uncertain results, not clear answers. For example, some reports suggest they can only get some information when Monero is used with other types of digital money that are not private or when it's used on regular exchanges.

#### 2\. CipherTrace’s Monero Analysis Tool

**Attempt**: In 2020, CipherTrace claimed they had tools to track Monero transactions and offered these tools to the government.

**Methodology**:

- **Transaction Heuristics**: CipherTrace said they could find patterns in the transaction data.
- **Network Analysis**: They would watch the internet addresses and other information when transactions were sent out on the network.

**Efficacy**: It's not clear how well this works. Some people say CipherTrace hasn't proven they can really track Monero transactions and question if their claims are true. Monero's developers and community have looked closely at what CipherTrace said and pointed out that there's no independent proof.

#### 3\. Academic Research: Breaking Monero’s Privacy with Statistical Analysis

**Attempt**: Some researchers have looked for weak spots in Monero's privacy. For example, in 2017, researchers looked at Monero's ring signature system.

**Methodology**:

- **Statistical Analysis of Ring Signatures**: The researchers found problems in older versions of Monero's ring signature system, where the fake information wasn't chosen randomly enough.
- **Temporal Analysis**: They looked at when outputs were used as inputs in later transactions to guess connections.

**Efficacy**: This was important, but it's old news. Monero's developers fixed these problems by making RingCT required and improving how the fake information is chosen.

#### 4\. Blockchain Analysis Firms and Metadata Correlation

**Attempt**: Companies like Elliptic have tried to connect outside information to Monero users to find out who they are.

**Methodology**:

- **Exchange Data**: They try to match Monero transactions to known addresses on exchanges.
- **IP and Geolocation Data**: They use internet surveillance to track where transactions are sent from.

**Efficacy**: This only works sometimes. It depends on how careful users are and if they use exchanges that require them to share their personal information.

#### 5\. Government Initiatives: The IRS Bounty Program

**Attempt**: In 2020, the IRS offered money to anyone who could break Monero's privacy.

**Methodology**:

- **Collaborations with Analytics Firms**: They worked with Chainalysis and Integra FEC to create Monero-tracking tools.
- **Network Surveillance**: They used outside data and possibly timing attacks.

**Efficacy**: It's not known if this worked. While they did work with companies, there's no public evidence that they were able to track Monero transactions.

* * *

#### 6\. Community-Driven Efforts: “Breaking Monero” Series

**Attempt**: The Monero Research Lab and community members created a series called "Breaking Monero" to find and fix potential problems.

**Methodology**:

- **White-Hat Analysis**: They looked at how transactions could be linked, how fake information was chosen, and how network attacks could work.
- **Ongoing Hard Forks**: They made updates to improve Monero's privacy features.

**Efficacy**: This is a good way to keep Monero safe. These efforts have made Monero harder to track.

### Conclusion: Monero’s Privacy Remains Resilient

Even though many people have tried to track Monero transactions, Monero's privacy features have worked well. Some methods have found weak spots or made guesses about who is using Monero, but no one has been able to reliably track everyone. Monero's developers continue to make it safer, so it remains a good choice for people who want privacy.
