I use [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) and simple AI tools to build my own online pocket alternative.
I save webpages that I really enjoy reading or want to mention in my posts.

This part of the wiki is automatically generated, so it may not be in perfect condition and could contain broken links or styling issues.
When I review and update these resources, they will be moved to the [[coolThingsOnline]] folder.
If you are the owner of any content listed here and would like it removed, please contact me and I will take it down.
