Data tampering happens when someone changes data in a system without permission. This can happen while the data is moving from one place to another or while it's stored. This can mess up important information and cause problems like people getting access they shouldn't, prices being wrong, or the system not working right.

Tampering attacks often target weak parts of systems like insecure connections, things controlled on the user's side, hidden information, or server logic that isn't checked well. If a system doesn't have strong checks, people can change data to get an advantage or cause trouble.

Common ways this happens include changing things in online requests, changing cookies or session data, adding harmful code to database requests, or changing code on the user's side to get around restrictions.

```

<input type="hidden" name="price" value="9.99">

```

Someone using tools can change the price to 0.01 before sending the request:

```

POST /checkout
price=0.01&product_id=123

```

If the system doesn't check the price again, the person buys the item for the wrong price.

If login information is stored in cookies on the user's computer without protection, someone can change it:

```

Cookie: role=user

```

Changing it to:

```

Cookie: role=admin

```

might give them access to things they shouldn't if the server trusts the cookie without checking.

Connections that accept data in a certain format are weak if they don't check important information on the server:

```

{
  "user_id": 1001,
  "amount": 100.00
}

```

Someone intercepting this request might change the user's ID to move money from another account:

```

{
  "user_id": 1002,
  "amount": 0.01
}

```

If important data is only checked on the user's side, attackers can get around these checks by changing code or using tools to send altered values directly.

1.  **Use Strong Checks on the Server Side**

    *   Never trust data from the user. Check and clean all data on the server.
    *   Use strict rules for online requests.
2.  **Use Integrity Checks**

    *   Protect important data in cookies using digital signatures or encryption.
    *   Make sure values like prices can't be changed outside the server.
3.  **Don't Rely on Hidden Information or User-Side Logic**

    *   Don't show important variables in the frontend.
    *   Recalculate values on the server.
4.  **Secure Connections**

    *   Use secure connections to protect data and prevent interception.
5.  **Use Logging and Monitoring**

    *   Log all important transactions to find tampering attempts.
    *   Use monitoring to find suspicious activity.
6.  **Use Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC)**

    *   Make sure users can only do things that are allowed for their role.
    *   Check permissions on every request, not just at login.
7.  **Use Hashing for Important Data**

    *   Use hashing to make sure data hasn't been changed.
    *   Check hashes before processing data.
