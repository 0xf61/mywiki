Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) happens when an attacker puts bad code into a place where you can type things, and that code shows up right away in the answer without being saved on the computer. Unlike stored XSS, which stays in the computer's memory, reflected XSS is only temporary. The bad code is usually in a special link or form that someone has to click or visit.

Because the bad script runs in the person's web browser, it can steal their login information, take over their accounts, or do things as if it were them. Reflected XSS really depends on tricking people: attackers have to get users to click a special link or send bad data.

An application puts what the user types directly into the answer. For example, a search form:

`https://example.com/search?q=someinput`

If the computer code puts `someinput` into the HTML page without cleaning it up, an attacker can make a link with a bad script:

`https://example.com/search?q=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`

When someone clicks this link, the browser runs the script on the page.

If a web form takes what the user types from a POST request and shows it on the page (like an error message or confirmation) without cleaning it, an attacker can send bad code:

```

<script>alert('Reflected XSS');</script>

```

The answer then shows this script, making the browser run it whenever the person looks at the result page.

1. **Check and Clean What Users Type**
   - Get rid of or block dangerous letters or HTML tags.
   - Use good libraries or frameworks that clean up HTML for your language.
2. **Encode Output Correctly**
   - Change all changing content when putting it in HTML, JavaScript, or other places.
   - For example, use HTML encoding for data in HTML text, and JavaScript encoding for data in scripts.
3. **Use a Content Security Policy (CSP)**
   - Set up `script-src`, `object-src`, and other rules to stop scripts from running.
   - This adds a strong defense if an XSS problem is found.
4. **Use Server-Side Security Libraries and Frameworks**
   - If your framework can automatically clean or encode things, turn it on.
   - Don't make raw HTML strings by adding user input; instead, use systems that know about XSS.
