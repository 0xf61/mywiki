Broken Access Control is a big security problem. It happens when apps don't check properly who is allowed to do what. This can let bad guys see, change, or delete important information and do things they shouldn't. This happens when the rules about what users can do aren't set up right. It can lead to information leaks and other problems. Bad guys can get around these rules by changing things in the app or finding hidden parts of the system.

Common Problems:

- Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
- Missing or Weak Checks
- Privilege Escalation (Horizontal & Vertical)
- Forced Browsing (Accessing Hidden Areas)
- Improper Session Handling
- Getting around Checks by Changing Things

To fix these problems, apps should use role-based access control (RBAC), only give users the necessary permissions, check permissions every time, use secure ways to refer to objects, and test access controls often to stop unauthorized access.
