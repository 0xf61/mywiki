# Is Monero Totally Private? A Comprehensive Analysis of De-Anonymization Attacks Against The Privacy Coin

### Analyzing Attempts to Discover and Track Monero Transactions: A Technical and Strategic Overview.

**December 23, 2024**

**By: Trevor Baaddi**

Monero (XMR) is a digital currency known for keeping transactions private. It has attracted attention from governments, cybersecurity experts, and analytics companies who want to find out who is making these transactions. Unlike Bitcoin, where everyone can see the transactions on the blockchain, Monero uses special privacy features like ring signatures, stealth addresses, and confidential transactions. This article looks at some attempts to break Monero's privacy, explaining how they tried to do it, how well it worked, and what the limits were.

#### Monero’s Privacy Features: A Brief Overview

To understand why it's hard to find out who is using Monero, it helps to know how its privacy features work:

- **Ring Signatures**: These mix the sender's transaction with other fake transactions, making it hard to know where the transaction really came from.
- **Stealth Addresses**: These create unique, one-time addresses for each transaction, so they can't be linked back to a public address.
- **Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT)**: These hide the amount of money being sent.
- **Dandelion++ Protocol**: This makes it harder to trace where a transaction started on the network.

Together, these features make Monero's blockchain very private, which makes it difficult to use normal blockchain tracking methods.

* * *

#### 1\. Chainalysis and Monero Tracking Services

**Attempt**: Chainalysis, a company that analyzes blockchains, has reportedly created tools that can give some information about Monero transactions. The details are not well known because their methods are secret, but Chainalysis has said they have had some success tracking Monero.

**Methodology**: They likely try to find weaknesses, like looking at the timing of transactions or connecting information from other sources (like when people deposit or withdraw Monero from exchanges).

**Efficacy**: Limited. Chainalysis's methods reportedly give possible results, but not definite answers. For example, contracts with law enforcement suggest they might only be partly successful when Monero is used with less private digital currencies or exchanges.

* * *

#### 2\. CipherTrace’s Monero Analysis Tool

**Attempt**: In 2020, CipherTrace claimed they had developed tools to track Monero transactions and offered these tools to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

**Methodology**:

- **Transaction Patterns**: CipherTrace said they could find patterns or unusual things in the transaction data.
- **Network Analysis**: Watching IP addresses and network information when transactions are sent out.

**Efficacy**: Questionable. Some people say CipherTrace has not proven they can completely find out who is using Monero and doubt their claims. Monero's developers and community have looked closely at CipherTrace's claims and pointed out that they haven't been independently checked.

* * *

#### 3\. Academic Research: Breaking Monero’s Privacy with Statistical Analysis

**Attempt**: Some academic papers have looked at weaknesses in Monero's privacy. One example is a 2017 study by Möser, Kappos, and Böhme, which looked at Monero's ring signature system.

**Methodology**:

- **Statistical Analysis of Ring Signatures**: The researchers found problems in older versions of Monero's ring signature system, where the fake transactions weren't chosen randomly enough.
- **Temporal Analysis**: Looking at when transactions were used in later transactions to guess who might be related.

**Efficacy**: Significant but outdated. Monero developers quickly fixed these problems by making RingCT required and improving how fake transactions are chosen.

* * *

#### 4\. Blockchain Analysis Firms and Metadata Correlation

**Attempt**: Companies like Elliptic have looked at connecting off-chain data to indirectly find out who is using Monero.

**Methodology**:

- **Exchange Data**: Linking Monero transactions to known addresses on centralized exchanges.
- **IP and Geolocation Data**: Using network surveillance to track transaction broadcasts.

**Efficacy**: Partial. How well this works depends on how careful users are with their security and whether they use exchanges that require identifying information.

* * *

#### 5\. Government Initiatives: The IRS Bounty Program

**Attempt**: In 2020, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) offered \$625,000 to anyone who could break Monero's privacy.

**Methodology**:

- **Collaborations with Analytics Firms**: Working with Chainalysis and Integra FEC to develop Monero-tracking tools.
- **Network Surveillance**: Using outside data and possibly timing attacks.

**Efficacy**: Unknown/Zero. While the bounty led to partnerships, there's no public proof that these efforts have completely found out who is using Monero.

* * *

#### 6\. Community-Driven Efforts: “Breaking Monero” Series

**Attempt**: The Monero Research Lab and community members created the “Breaking Monero” series to proactively find and fix possible weaknesses.

**Methodology**:

- **White-Hat Analysis**: Looking at how transactions can be linked, how fake transactions are chosen, and network-level attacks.
- **Ongoing Hard Forks**: Making upgrades to improve Monero's privacy features.

**Efficacy**: Proactive and strong. These efforts have made Monero more resistant to tracking.

* * *

### Conclusion: Monero’s Privacy Remains Resilient

Despite attempts by governments, companies, and researchers to find out who is using Monero, its privacy features have been very strong. While some methods have taken advantage of weaknesses or made anonymity less certain, none have reliably found out who is using Monero. Monero's active development community continues to make its defenses stronger, ensuring it remains a top choice for users who want privacy.
