Insecure Design means there are problems in how an application is built or how it works, which makes it easier to attack. These problems aren't just mistakes in the code, but come from not planning for security well enough. This can include not thinking about possible threats or not using good security rules when designing the application. Insecure design can lead to seeing data that you shouldn't, getting around login systems, doing things you're not allowed to, or misusing how the application is supposed to work.

Common Problems:

- Not thinking about threats and checking for security issues when building the application
- Missing or weak ways to log in and give permissions
- Problems in how the application works that allow people to do things they shouldn't (like skipping payment steps)
- Not protecting data well enough (like saving important data without any protection)
- Not separating permissions properly or giving too many permissions to accounts
- Not having security measures to limit how quickly an API can be used and prevent abuse

To make these problems less likely, applications should use good security practices from the beginning, have strong login and permission systems, only give the necessary permissions, think about possible threats, and use secure coding rules. Regular security checks and tests should be done to find and fix design problems before the application is released.
