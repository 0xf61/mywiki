Security Misconfiguration happens when apps, servers, or systems are set up with unsafe default settings, open configurations, or wrong permissions, which can make them easy to attack. These mistakes often happen because of features that aren't needed, too many privileges, old software, or not making the security strong enough. This can cause data to leak, unauthorized people to get in, and systems to be damaged.

Common Problems:

- Showing Debug or Error Messages that have Private Information
- Using Default or Weak Passwords
- Giving Too Much Permission to Files, Folders, or Cloud Items
- Using Software that hasn't been Updated and has Known Weaknesses
- Setting Security Headers Incorrectly (Missing CSP, HSTS, or X-Frame-Options)
- Letting Anyone Get into Admin Areas or APIs

To make these risks less likely, apps should turn off features they don't need, make sure only authorized people can get in, update software regularly, set security headers correctly, and check for security problems to find mistakes in the setup. Using automated tools to manage settings and using security guidelines can also help reduce the chances of problems.
